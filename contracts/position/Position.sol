// @title Position
// @dev Stuct for positions
//
// borrowing fees for position require only a borrowingFactor to track
// an example on how this works is if the global cumulativeBorrowingFactor is 10020%
// a position would be opened with borrowingFactor as 10020%
// after some time, if the cumulativeBorrowingFactor is updated to 10025% the position would
// owe 5% of the position size as borrowing fees
// the total pending borrowing fees of all positions is factored into the calculation of the pool value for LPs
// when a position is increased or decreased, the pending borrowing fees for the position is deducted from the position's
// collateral and transferred into the LP pool
//
// the same borrowing fee factor tracking cannot be applied for funding fees as those calculations consider pending funding fees
// based on the fiat value of the position sizes
//
// for example, if the price of the longToken is $2000 and a long position owes $200 in funding fees, the opposing short position
// claims the funding fees of 0.1 longToken ($200), if the price of the longToken changes to $4000 later, the long position would
// only owe 0.05 longToken ($200)
// this would result in differences between the amounts deducted and amounts paid out, for this reason, the actual token amounts
// to be deducted and to be paid out need to be tracked instead
//
// for funding fees, there are four values to consider:
// 1. long positions with market.longToken as collateral
// 2. long positions with market.shortToken as collateral
// 3. short positions with market.longToken as collateral
// 4. short positions with market.shortToken as collateral
