an example on how this works is if the global cumulativeBorrowingFactor is 10020%\\n// a position would be opened with borrowingFactor as 10020%\\n// after some time, if the cumulativeBorrowingFactor is updated to 10025% the position would\\n// owe 5% of the position size as borrowing fees\\n// the total pending borrowing fees of all positions is factored into the calculation of the pool value for LPs\\n// when a position is increased or decreased, the pending borrowing fees for the position is deducted from the position's\\n// collateral and transferred into the LP pool\\n//\\n// the same borrowing fee factor tracking cannot be applied for funding fees as those calculations consider pending funding fees\\n// based on the fiat value of the position sizes\\n//\\n// for example, if the price of the longToken is $2000 and a long position owes $200 in funding fees, the opposing short position\\n// claims the funding fees of 0.1 longToken ($200), if the price of the longToken changes to $4000 later, the long position would\\n// only owe 0.05 longToken ($200)\\n// this would result in differences between the amounts deducted and amounts paid out, for this reason, the actual token amounts\\n// to be deducted and to be paid out need to be tracked instead\\n//\\n// for funding fees, there are four values to consider:\\n// 1. long positions with market.longToken as collateral\\n//

pool would now have $100,000 of long\\n// tokens and $50,000 of short tokens\\n// - The change in imbalance would be from $0 to -$50,000\\n// - There would be negative price impact charged on the
