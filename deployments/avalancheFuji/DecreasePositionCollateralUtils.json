(deposits, withdrawals, swaps), imbalance is calculated as the\\n// difference in the worth of the long tokens and short tokens.\\n//\\n// For example:\\n//\\n// - A pool has 10 long tokens, each long token is worth $5000\\n// - The pool also has 50,000 short tokens, each short token is worth $1\\n// - The `price impact exponent` is set to 2 and `price impact factor` is set\\n// to `0.01 / 50,000`\\n// - The pool is equally balanced with $50,000 of long tokens and $50,000 of\\n// short tokens\\n// - If a user deposits 10 long tokens, the pool would now have $100,000 of long\\n// tokens and $50,000 of short tokens\\n// - The change in imbalance would be from $0 to -$50,000\\n// - There would be negative price impact charged on the user's deposit,\\n// calculated as `0 ^ 2 * (0.01 / 50,000) - 50,000 ^ 2 * (0.01 / 50,000) => -$500`\\n// - If the user now withdraws 5 long tokens, the balance would change\\n// from -$50,000 to -$25,000, a net change of +$25,000\\n// - There would be a positive price impact rebated to the user in the form of\\n// additional long tokens, calculated as `50,000 ^ 2 * (0.01 / 50,000) - 25,000 ^ 2 * (0.01 / 50,000) => $375`\\n//\\n// For position actions (increase / decrease position), imbalance is calculated\\n// as the difference in the long and short open interest.\\n//\\n// `price impact exponents` and `price impact factors` are configured per market\\n// and can differ for spot and position actions.\\n//\\n// The purpose of the price impact is to help reduce the risk of price manipulation,\\n// since the contracts use an oracle price which would be an average or median price\\n// of multiple reference exchanges. Without a price impact, it may be profitable to\\n//  manipulate the prices on reference exchanges while executing orders on the contracts.\\n//\\n// This risk will also be present if the positive and
